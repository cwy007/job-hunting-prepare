So until something changes, URI is best used when you’re referring to a resource just by its name or some other fragment.

And when you’re giving both the name of a resource and the method of accessing it (like a full URL), it’s best to call that a URL.


# Summary

1. URIs are identifiers, and that can mean name, location, or both.
2. All URNs and URLs are URIs, but the opposite is not true.
3. The part that makes something a URL is the combination of the name and an access method, such as `https://`, or `mailto:`.
4. All these bits are URIs, so saying that is always technically accurate, but if you are discussing something that’s both a full URL and a URI (which all URLs are), it’s best to call it a “URL” because it’s more specific.
